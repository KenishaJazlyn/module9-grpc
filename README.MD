1. Key Differences Between Unary, Server Streaming, and Bi-directional Streaming RPC Methods:
- Unary RPC: Simple request-response pattern. Client sends a request and server returns a single response. It's suitable for straightforward operations like fetching user data.
- Server Streaming RPC: The client sends a request and receives a stream of responses from the server. Useful for scenarios like sending live updates or continuous data, such as stock prices.
- Bi-directional Streaming RPC: Both client and server can send a sequence of messages to each other in any order. This is ideal for interactive applications like real-time chat systems.
2. Security Considerations in gRPC Service with Rust:
- Authentication: Ensuring the client and server can verify each other’s identity.
- Authorization: Controlling access to different parts of the service based on user roles or permissions.
- Data Encryption: Securing data in transit, typically using TLS/SSL, to prevent interception.
3. Challenges in Handling Bi-directional Streaming in Rust gRPC:
- Managing the complexity of asynchronous communication.
- Ensuring thread safety and efficient error handling.
- Dealing with connection stability and message order guarantees in interactive applications like chat.
4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Using tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream:
- Advantages: Integrates well with Rust’s asynchronous ecosystem, helping in managing stream-based data efficiently.
- Disadvantages: Potentially adds complexity in managing lifetimes and error handling due to the asynchronous nature of streams.
5. Structuring Rust gRPC Code for Modularity and Maintainability:
- Using traits and modules to encapsulate gRPC methods.
- Implement common functionality as reusable libraries.
- Ensure clear separation of concerns between service logic and communication layers.
6. Complex Payment Processing in MyPaymentService:
- Implementing transaction management and error handling.
- Adding support for multiple payment gateways.
- Ensuring secure handling of sensitive payment information.
7. Impact of Adopting gRPC on Distributed Systems Architecture:
- Facilitates efficient, high-performance communication.
- Requires adherence to strict interface definitions but ensures better compatibility and interoperability across different platforms.
8. Advantages and Disadvantages of HTTP/2 for gRPC vs. HTTP/1.1:
- Advantages: Better performance through multiplexing, smaller headers, and binary encoding.
- Disadvantages: More complex to implement and debug than HTTP/1.1; less widely understood.
9. REST APIs vs. gRPC for Real-Time Communication:
- REST APIs are typically request-response based and not optimized for real-time updates.
- gRPC offers streaming capabilities which are ideal for real-time data exchange and updates.
10. Implications of Schema-based vs. Schema-less Approaches:
- gRPC (Schema-based): Ensures type safety and uniformity of data structures, but less flexible in accommodating changes.
- REST API (Schema-less): More flexible with JSON payloads, allowing for ad-hoc data structures, but potentially riskier in terms of data integrity.
